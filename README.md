# first-game-repo
Users are approached by a Jadwiega. 
Users click her to initiate exposition and to answer questions
Stats increase or decrease depending on their answer. 
Characters disappear when their conversation is over. 
New characters appear after a message appears about them. 

(User should be able to pick 2 different choices during most conversations and your charisma or repulsiveness  will reflect how you answer the questions.
Clicking on the picture of your characters you are talking with.
Jadwiega is always with you.
100 questions and answers that increase or decrease your stats, but always bring you closer to the end of the game - which is solving Jadwiega's sister's death.
Progress bar will increase with every step closer to completing the game.)

Minimum viable product will be:
Ability to win or lose the game
Repulsiveness/Charisma tracker is working
Ability to click answer no. 1 or no. 2

May add inventory and items, if time permits.
May add clickable background elements. Or maybe the clues are in the back ground.
